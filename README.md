# Alignment System UI

This project is a Flask-based web application that provides a simple user interface to run and monitor a background controller process. The controller process is executed in a separate thread and its output is streamed in real time to the UI using Server-Sent Events (SSE).

## Features

- **Start Controller Process:** Launch the controller process with a single click. The process runs in the background.
- **Live Log Streaming:** View real-time logs generated by the controller process.
- **Responsive UI:** The interface uses CSS for styling and is mobile-friendly.

## Project Structure

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd AlignmentSystemUI
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   This project requires Flask. Install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask Application:**

   Run the application by executing the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the UI:**

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to view the main page.  
   Click the **Start controller** button on the home page to run the controller process.  
   In the controller view page, click **Show Logs** to view live output from the process.

## How It Works

- The main Flask application (`app.py`) uses threading to run `controller.py` as a background process.
- The output of the controller process is collected and stored in a shared log buffer.
- An SSE (Server-Sent Events) endpoint (`/stream`) streams the log data to the browser, where client-side JavaScript updates the log view in real time.

## Troubleshooting

- **Virtual Environment Issues:** Make sure you have activated the virtual environment if you are using one.
